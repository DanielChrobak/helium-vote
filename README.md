A polling website that enables a simple For or Against Vote for Helium related initiatives and Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs). This is the official polling mechanism for voting on HIPs in the Helium community.

## Features

* A vote can be created by opening a PR against this repository.
* A Helium account can specify an outcome preference by burning a small amount of DC against an address.
* A block height deadline is set for the tally to be taken.
* Votes are tallied by the HNT voting "power" of the account. One HNT = 1 Vote.
